<a href="https://www.home-designing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Real-life-Barbie-Malibu-Dreamhouse.jpg">Barbie Dreamhouse.</a></br>
<br>Everyone knows that Barbie owns a pink mansion, so to become a barbie, you will inevitabely need to own a mansion as well. To do 
that, you will need a lot of money, which leads us to the next step.</br><br>Step 2: Get several jobs</br><br>Barbie is known for having
 a different job everyday, which you will have to replicate in order to become a barbie. To become the best barbie version of yourself,
you should get a job for each day of the year, but getting a job for each day of the week would work fine. Here are a few suggestions:</br>
<br><p>-Teacher</p><p>-Firefighter</p><p>-pilot</p><p>-Matchmaker</p><p>-Environmentalist</p><p>-Diver</p><p>-On sundays, Barbie relaxes.</p>
</br><br>Step 3: The Barbiecore aesthetic</br><br>To become a Barbie, there is no specific look that you should go for, but the most 
important rule in barbiecore fashion is that the outfit must always include pink (there are a few exceptions but otherwise it should 
always include pink). The Barbiecore look is the most crucial step to becoming a barbie.</br> </div>
